/*
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that
the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains
the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.
Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case,
the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1


Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104

    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int maxArea = 0;
        while (left < right) {
            // Calculate area
            int width = right - left;
            int minHeight = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, width * minHeight);

            // Move the pointer with the smaller height
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {

            }
